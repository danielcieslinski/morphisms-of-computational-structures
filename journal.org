Some of these connections where what drew may attention to find that there is morphisms happening across different control constructs.

*** Continuations vs. Lazy Evaluation
Chris Okasaki has found the link between [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01019945][Lazy Evaluation / Call by Need and Continuations]].

*** Closures vs. Actors
Closures â€” Actor isomorphism was demonstrated by Guy Steele/Dan Friedman but was [[https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1008/1008.1459v8.pdf][rejected by Hewitt]].

*** Montague Quantification vs. Continuations
Natural language exhibiting continuations is described by Barker [[https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/cw04/barker.pdf][here]] and in [[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.454.8690&rep=rep1&type=pdf][this book]].

*** Initial/Final (Co)Algebras
